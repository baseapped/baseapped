Hey, Iâ€™m Philip (@baseapped), the founder of Baseapped LLC, 
a startup dedicated to developing integrated IoT hubs for both residential and commercial use.
We focus on integrating various IoT sensors and switching communication to a centralized hub. Currently,
I'm learning how to automate IoT control and incorporate AI assistance into our systems.

I'm looking to collaborate on creating an IoT integrated hub with AI assistance capabilities.
